Since the page is refreshed with parameters, the related API calls are being made again. I have designed my tests to wait until all the APIs have fully loaded before proceeding. This process could be optimized by ensuring that content is not displayed before the page load is complete when the link contains parameters. This improvement could make the page loading process more efficient.
